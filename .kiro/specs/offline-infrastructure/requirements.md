# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive offline functionality for UnifiedHQ, enabling users to access and interact with the dashboard even when network connectivity is limited or unavailable. The system will provide intelligent caching, background synchronization, and optimized asset delivery to ensure a seamless user experience across all network conditions.

## Glossary

- **Service_Worker**: A JavaScript worker that acts as a proxy between the web application and the network, enabling offline functionality and caching strategies
- **Redis_Cache**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching API responses and session data
- **CDN_System**: Content Delivery Network that serves static assets from geographically distributed servers
- **Background_Sync**: A web API that allows the service worker to defer actions until the user has stable connectivity
- **Cache_Strategy**: The logic determining how and when to cache, serve, and update cached content
- **Offline_Queue**: A local storage mechanism that holds user actions performed while offline for later synchronization

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to access the UnifiedHQ dashboard even when my internet connection is unstable, so that I can continue viewing team activities and insights without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the dashboard while offline, THE Service_Worker SHALL serve cached content from local storage
2. WHILE the user is offline, THE Service_Worker SHALL display a clear offline indicator in the user interface
3. IF the user attempts to access uncached content while offline, THEN THE Service_Worker SHALL display an appropriate offline message with cached alternatives
4. WHERE cached data exists, THE Service_Worker SHALL serve the most recent cached version with a timestamp indicator
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Service_Worker SHALL automatically update cached content in the background

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis caching to reduce database load and improve response times, so that the application can handle more concurrent users efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made for frequently accessed data, THE Redis_Cache SHALL serve the cached response if available
2. THE Redis_Cache SHALL store API responses with configurable expiration times based on data type
3. WHEN cached data expires, THE Redis_Cache SHALL automatically remove stale entries and fetch fresh data
4. IF the Redis cache is unavailable, THEN THE System SHALL fallback to direct database queries without service interruption
5. THE Redis_Cache SHALL implement cache invalidation strategies for real-time data updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want static assets to load quickly from any location, so that the dashboard feels responsive regardless of my geographic location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CDN_System SHALL serve all static assets including images, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN a user requests static content, THE CDN_System SHALL serve from the nearest geographic location
3. THE CDN_System SHALL implement proper cache headers for optimal browser caching
4. IF the CDN is unavailable, THEN THE System SHALL fallback to serving assets from the origin server
5. THE CDN_System SHALL support automatic cache invalidation when assets are updated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want my actions performed while offline to be automatically synchronized when I reconnect, so that no data is lost during connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs actions while offline, THE Offline_Queue SHALL store these actions locally
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Background_Sync SHALL automatically process queued actions
3. THE Background_Sync SHALL handle action conflicts and provide resolution strategies
4. IF synchronization fails, THEN THE System SHALL retry with exponential backoff and notify the user
5. THE Offline_Queue SHALL persist across browser sessions and application restarts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent cache management that balances performance with data freshness, so that users see up-to-date information while maintaining fast load times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cache_Strategy SHALL implement different caching policies for static content, API responses, and real-time data
2. WHEN real-time data is updated, THE Cache_Strategy SHALL invalidate related cached entries
3. THE Cache_Strategy SHALL implement cache warming for frequently accessed content
4. THE System SHALL provide cache statistics and monitoring capabilities for performance optimization
5. WHERE storage limits are reached, THE Cache_Strategy SHALL implement intelligent eviction policies based on usage patterns
