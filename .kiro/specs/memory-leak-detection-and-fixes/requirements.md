# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on identifying, analyzing, and fixing memory leaks in the UnifiedHQ Next.js application. Memory leaks can cause performance degradation, increased memory usage, and potential application crashes over time. The system needs to detect common memory leak patterns, provide automated fixes where possible, and establish monitoring to prevent future leaks.

## Glossary

- **Memory_Leak_Detector**: The system component responsible for scanning code and runtime for memory leak patterns
- **Cleanup_Manager**: The component that manages proper cleanup of resources like event listeners, intervals, and subscriptions
- **Performance_Monitor**: The existing system component that tracks application performance metrics
- **React_Hook**: Custom React hooks that manage component lifecycle and state
- **Event_Listener**: Browser API listeners attached to DOM elements or global objects
- **Subscription**: Observable or event-based subscriptions that need cleanup
- **Interval_Timer**: JavaScript setInterval or setTimeout functions that need clearing
- **Memory_Profiler**: Tool for analyzing memory usage patterns and detecting leaks

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically detect memory leaks in my React components, so that I can identify and fix performance issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Memory_Leak_Detector scans React components, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL identify components with missing cleanup in useEffect hooks
2. WHEN the Memory_Leak_Detector finds event listeners without removal, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL report the specific file and line number
3. WHEN the Memory_Leak_Detector discovers uncleaned intervals or timeouts, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL flag them as potential memory leaks
4. WHEN the Memory_Leak_Detector analyzes subscription patterns, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL verify proper unsubscribe mechanisms exist
5. THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all detected memory leak patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated fixes for common memory leak patterns, so that I can quickly resolve issues without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Cleanup_Manager detects missing useEffect cleanup, THE Cleanup_Manager SHALL automatically add return statements with proper cleanup functions
2. WHEN the Cleanup_Manager finds event listeners without removeEventListener, THE Cleanup_Manager SHALL add the corresponding cleanup code
3. WHEN the Cleanup_Manager discovers uncleaned intervals, THE Cleanup_Manager SHALL add clearInterval or clearTimeout in cleanup functions
4. WHEN the Cleanup_Manager identifies subscription leaks, THE Cleanup_Manager SHALL implement proper unsubscribe patterns
5. THE Cleanup_Manager SHALL preserve existing functionality while adding cleanup mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor memory usage in real-time, so that I can detect memory leaks during development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL track memory usage metrics including heap size and garbage collection frequency
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds defined thresholds, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL trigger alerts
3. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL integrate with existing performance monitoring to provide memory leak insights
4. WHEN memory leaks are detected at runtime, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL provide memory usage trends over time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish best practices for preventing memory leaks, so that future code follows proper cleanup patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL provide ESLint rules to catch common memory leak patterns during development
2. WHEN developers write new React hooks, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL validate proper cleanup implementation
3. THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL integrate with the existing code review process to flag potential memory leaks
4. WHEN new event listeners are added, THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL ensure corresponding cleanup is implemented
5. THE Memory_Leak_Detector SHALL provide documentation and examples of proper cleanup patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test memory leak fixes, so that I can verify the effectiveness of implemented solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Memory_Profiler SHALL provide tools to measure memory usage before and after fixes
2. WHEN running memory leak tests, THE Memory_Profiler SHALL simulate user interactions to trigger potential leaks
3. THE Memory_Profiler SHALL generate reports comparing memory usage across different scenarios
4. WHEN memory leaks are fixed, THE Memory_Profiler SHALL verify that memory is properly released
5. THE Memory_Profiler SHALL integrate with existing testing infrastructure for automated memory leak testing
