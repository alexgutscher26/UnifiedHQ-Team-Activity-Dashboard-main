# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements organization-based multi-tenancy for UnifiedHQ, allowing multiple teams to use the platform with complete data isolation. Each organization acts as a tenant with its own members, integrations, settings, and activity data. Users can belong to multiple organizations and switch between them seamlessly.

## Glossary

- **Organization**: A tenant entity that groups users, integrations, and data together with complete isolation
- **Organization Member**: A user who belongs to an organization with a specific role and permissions
- **Organization Slug**: A unique, URL-friendly identifier for an organization used in routing
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete separation of data between organizations at the database level
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permission system based on user roles within an organization
- **Personal Organization**: An automatically created organization for each user upon signup
- **Organization Switcher**: UI component allowing users to switch between organizations they belong to
- **Invitation System**: Secure token-based system for inviting users to join organizations
