# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive set of GitHub workflows for the UnifiedHQ project to automate CI/CD processes, code quality checks, security scanning, and deployment operations. The workflows will ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments while supporting the team's development workflow.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Workflows**: Automated processes that run on GitHub Actions platform triggered by repository events
- **CI_Pipeline**: Continuous Integration pipeline that runs tests, linting, and quality checks
- **CD_Pipeline**: Continuous Deployment pipeline that handles application deployment
- **Security_Scanner**: Automated tools that scan code for vulnerabilities and security issues
- **Quality_Gate**: Automated checks that must pass before code can be merged or deployed
- **Dependency_Scanner**: Tools that check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- **Performance_Monitor**: Automated performance testing and monitoring tools
- **Release_Manager**: Automated system for creating and managing software releases

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL run comprehensive quality checks including linting, type checking, and testing
2. WHEN code is pushed to main branch, THE CD_Pipeline SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
3. WHEN all quality gates pass, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL allow merge to main branch
4. WHERE deployment to production is requested, THE CD_Pipeline SHALL require manual approval
5. WHILE CI_Pipeline is running, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL provide clear status feedback to developers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious team, I want automated security scanning, so that vulnerabilities are detected early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch, THE Security_Scanner SHALL scan for code vulnerabilities and security issues
2. WHEN dependencies are updated, THE Dependency_Scanner SHALL check for known vulnerabilities
3. IF security vulnerabilities are found, THEN THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL block merge until issues are resolved
4. THE Security_Scanner SHALL generate security reports for each scan
5. WHEN critical security issues are detected, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL notify team members immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want automated release management, so that software releases are consistent and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release tag is created, THE Release_Manager SHALL automatically create release notes from commit history
2. THE Release_Manager SHALL build and publish release artifacts to appropriate registries
3. WHEN a release is created, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL trigger deployment to production environment
4. THE Release_Manager SHALL maintain semantic versioning based on commit messages
5. WHERE release deployment fails, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL automatically rollback to previous version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated dependency management, so that dependencies stay up-to-date and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dependency_Scanner SHALL automatically check for dependency updates weekly
2. WHEN dependency updates are available, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL create pull requests with updates
3. THE Dependency_Scanner SHALL run security checks on all dependency updates
4. WHERE dependency updates break tests, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL provide clear failure reports
5. THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL automatically merge non-breaking dependency updates after quality checks pass

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious team, I want automated performance monitoring, so that performance regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL run performance benchmarks
2. IF performance degrades beyond threshold, THEN THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL block merge and notify developers
3. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL track performance metrics over time
4. WHEN performance improvements are detected, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL highlight improvements in PR comments
5. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL generate performance reports for each deployment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want automated code quality enforcement, so that code standards are consistently maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Quality_Gate SHALL enforce code formatting with Prettier
2. THE Quality_Gate SHALL enforce code quality rules with ESLint
3. THE Quality_Gate SHALL enforce TypeScript strict mode compliance
4. WHEN code quality checks fail, THE GitHub_Workflows SHALL provide detailed feedback with fix suggestions
5. THE Quality_Gate SHALL require all tests to pass before allowing merge
