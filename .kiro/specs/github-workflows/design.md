# GitHub Workflows Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow system for UnifiedHQ, providing automated CI/CD, security scanning, dependency management, performance monitoring, and release management. The system is designed to be modular, efficient, and aligned with modern DevOps practices.

## Architecture

### Workflow Organization

The workflows are organized into distinct categories:

1. **Core CI/CD Workflows** - Primary build, test, and deployment pipelines
2. **Quality Assurance Workflows** - Code quality, security, and performance checks  
3. **Maintenance Workflows** - Dependency updates, cleanup, and monitoring
4. **Release Workflows** - Version management and release automation

### Trigger Strategy

- **Pull Request Events**: Quality checks, security scans, performance tests
- **Push to Main**: Staging deployment, comprehensive testing
- **Release Tags**: Production deployment, release notes generation
- **Scheduled Events**: Dependency updates, security scans, cleanup tasks
- **Manual Triggers**: Production deployments, emergency procedures

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Primary CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Main continuous integration pipeline for all code changes

**Triggers**: 
- Pull requests to main/develop branches
- Push to main/develop branches

**Jobs**:
- **Setup**: Environment preparation, dependency caching
- **Lint**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checks
- **Test**: Unit tests, integration tests with coverage
- **Build**: Next.js production build verification
- **Security**: CodeQL analysis, dependency vulnerability scan

**Matrix Strategy**: Test across Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)

### 2. Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated deployment to staging and production environments

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch (staging)
- Release tags (production with approval)

**Jobs**:
- **Build**: Create optimized production build
- **Deploy-Staging**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Deploy-Production**: Manual approval required, includes rollback capability

**Environment Variables**:
- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets
- Deployment targets

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis and vulnerability detection

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests
- Push to main
- Weekly scheduled scan

**Jobs**:
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **Dependency-Check**: OWASP dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Secret-Scan**: Detect accidentally committed secrets
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing

**Integration**: Results posted as PR comments and security advisories

### 4. Performance Monitoring (`performance.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated performance testing and regression detection

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests (performance comparison)
- Push to main (baseline updates)

**Jobs**:
- **Lighthouse**: Web performance audits
- **Bundle-Analysis**: JavaScript bundle size analysis
- **Load-Testing**: API endpoint performance testing
- **Memory-Profiling**: Memory leak detection

**Thresholds**:
- Performance score: >90
- Bundle size increase: <10%
- API response time: <500ms

### 5. Dependency Management (`dependencies.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated dependency updates and security monitoring

**Triggers**:
- Weekly schedule
- Manual trigger for urgent updates

**Jobs**:
- **Update-Check**: Scan for available updates
- **Security-Audit**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Auto-Update**: Create PRs for non-breaking updates
- **Notification**: Alert team of critical updates

**Strategy**: Separate PRs for major, minor, and patch updates

### 6. Release Management (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release creation and deployment

**Triggers**:
- Release tag creation
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs**:
- **Generate-Notes**: Create release notes from commits
- **Build-Artifacts**: Create production builds
- **Publish**: Deploy to production environment
- **Notify**: Send release notifications to team

**Versioning**: Semantic versioning based on conventional commits

## Data Models

### Workflow Configuration Schema

```yaml
# Common workflow structure
name: string
on: 
  push: { branches: string[] }
  pull_request: { branches: string[] }
  schedule: { cron: string }
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  job_name:
    runs-on: string
    strategy:
      matrix: object
    steps:
      - name: string
        uses: string
        with: object
        env: object
```

### Environment Configuration

```yaml
# Environment-specific settings
environments:
  staging:
    url: string
    secrets: string[]
    protection_rules: object
  production:
    url: string
    secrets: string[]
    protection_rules:
      required_reviewers: number
      deployment_branch_policy: object
```

### Cache Strategy

```yaml
# Dependency caching configuration
cache:
  node_modules:
    key: "${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lock') }}"
    paths: ["node_modules", "~/.bun/install/cache"]
  next_build:
    key: "${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lock') }}"
    paths: [".next/cache"]
```

## Error Handling

### Failure Recovery

1. **Retry Strategy**: Automatic retry for transient failures (network, API limits)
2. **Fallback Actions**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
3. **Notification System**: Immediate alerts for critical failures
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback for failed deployments

### Error Categorization

- **Build Failures**: Code compilation, dependency issues
- **Test Failures**: Unit test, integration test failures  
- **Security Failures**: Vulnerability detection, secret exposure
- **Deployment Failures**: Infrastructure, configuration issues

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Slack Integration**: Real-time failure notifications
- **GitHub Issues**: Automatic issue creation for recurring failures
- **Metrics Collection**: Workflow success rates, execution times
- **Dashboard**: Centralized view of workflow health

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow Testing

1. **Local Testing**: Use `act` tool for local workflow execution
2. **Branch Testing**: Test workflows on feature branches before merge
3. **Staging Validation**: Verify deployments work correctly in staging
4. **Rollback Testing**: Regular testing of rollback procedures

### Quality Gates

1. **Pre-merge Checks**: All quality workflows must pass
2. **Deployment Gates**: Security and performance thresholds
3. **Release Gates**: Comprehensive testing before production
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track process for critical fixes

### Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent jobs concurrently
2. **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of dependencies and builds
3. **Conditional Execution**: Skip unnecessary jobs based on file changes
4. **Resource Management**: Optimize runner usage and costs

## Integration Points

### External Services

- **Vercel**: Production deployment platform
- **Sentry**: Error monitoring and performance tracking
- **Slack**: Team notifications and alerts
- **GitHub Security**: Dependabot, security advisories

### Internal Systems

- **Database**: Migration and seeding in deployment pipeline
- **Redis**: Cache warming and health checks
- **API Endpoints**: Health checks and smoke tests
- **Authentication**: Service account management

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- **GitHub Secrets**: Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- **Environment Separation**: Different secrets for staging/production
- **Rotation Policy**: Regular rotation of API keys and tokens
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

### Code Security

- **Branch Protection**: Require PR reviews and status checks
- **Signed Commits**: Verify commit authenticity
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Secret Detection**: Prevent accidental secret commits

### Deployment Security

- **Environment Isolation**: Separate staging and production
- **Approval Gates**: Manual approval for production deployments
- **Audit Logging**: Complete deployment audit trail
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback for security incidents
