# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the UnifiedHQ project - a Next.js application that integrates with GitHub, Slack, and other third-party services to provide team activity tracking and AI-powered summaries.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Notes | End of Life |
