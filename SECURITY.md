# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the UnifiedHQ project - a Next.js application that integrates with GitHub, Slack, and other third-party services to provide team activity tracking and AI-powered summaries.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current development version |
| < 0.1   | :x:                | Not supported |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Better Auth**: OAuth 2.0 and OIDC authentication with session management
- **Session Security**: Secure session tokens with IP address and user agent tracking
- **OAuth Applications**: Support for custom OAuth applications with proper scoping
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Protection
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Token Storage**: Encrypted storage of OAuth tokens and API keys
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Cache Security**: User-specific cache keys to prevent data leakage

### API Security
- **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require valid session authentication
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all API inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure
- **CORS Protection**: Proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

## Third-Party Integrations

### GitHub Integration
- **OAuth Scopes**: Minimal required scopes for repository access
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and expiration handling
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Graceful handling of GitHub API rate limits
- **Repository Access**: User-controlled repository selection and permissions

### Slack Integration
- **Bot Permissions**: Minimal required bot permissions
- **Channel Access**: User-controlled channel selection
- **Token Security**: Secure storage of bot tokens and user tokens

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode for compile-time security
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates using Bun package manager
- **Code Review**: Mandatory code reviews for all changes
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier for code quality and security

### Deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of environment variables
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Security Headers**: Proper security headers configuration
- **Image Security**: Content Security Policy for SVG images

### Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for security monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance and security monitoring
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging without sensitive data exposure
- **Audit Trails**: User activity tracking and audit logs

## Vulnerability Reporting
