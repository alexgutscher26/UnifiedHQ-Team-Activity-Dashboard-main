# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to address various security warnings and vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## 1. Fixed Dangerous `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Usage

### Issue
The chart component (`src/components/ui/chart.tsx`) was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject CSS styles without proper sanitization, which could lead to XSS attacks.

### Solution
- Added comprehensive input sanitization for CSS values, keys, and IDs
- Implemented regex validation for color values (hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, named colors)
- Added validation for CSS property keys (alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only)
- Sanitized chart IDs to prevent CSS injection
- Added detailed comments explaining the security measures
- Added ESLint exception with justification

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Added sanitization functions and updated ChartStyle component
- `src/components/ui/__tests__/chart-security.test.ts` - Added security test framework

## 2. Replaced Dangerous Script Injection

### Issue
The offline page (`src/app/offline/page.tsx`) was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to inject JavaScript code directly into the DOM, creating a serious XSS vulnerability.

### Solution
- Completely removed the dangerous script injection
- Replaced with proper React hooks and effects (`useEffect`, `useState`)
- Implemented connection checking using proper async/await patterns
- Added proper event listener cleanup
- Used AbortSignal for fetch timeout handling

### Files Modified
- `src/app/offline/page.tsx` - Converted from server component to client component with proper React patterns

## 3. Implemented Safe Logging System

### Issue
Multiple files were logging unsanitized user input and error objects to the console, which could expose sensitive information or allow log injection attacks.

### Solution
- Created comprehensive safe logging utilities for both TypeScript and JavaScript
- Implemented input sanitization that removes control characters and limits log length
- Added automatic detection and redaction of sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, keys, etc.)
- Replaced all unsafe console.log/error calls with safe alternatives

### Files Created
- `src/lib/safe-logger.ts` - TypeScript safe logging utility
- `scripts/safe-logger.js` - Node.js safe logging utility

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/ai-summary/trigger/route.ts` - Updated to use safe logging
- `src/components/activity-feed.tsx` - Updated to use safe logging
- `scripts/deploy-cache-infrastructure.js` - Updated to use safe logging

## 4. Security Features Implemented

### Input Sanitization
- **Control Character Removal**: Strips control characters (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F-0x9F) from logs
- **Length Limiting**: Truncates log messages to prevent log flooding (max 1000 characters)
- **Sensitive Field Redaction**: Automatically detects and redacts sensitive fields like passwords, tokens, API keys
- **CSS Injection Prevention**: Validates CSS values and keys using strict regex patterns
- **XSS Prevention**: Eliminates dangerous script injection patterns

### Validation Patterns
- **Color Values**: `/^(#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}|rgb\([^)]+\)|rgba\([^)]+\)|hsl\([^)]+\)|hsla\([^)]+\)|[a-zA-Z]+)$/`
- **CSS Keys**: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`
- **Chart IDs**: Sanitized to alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only

### Error Handling
- **Stack Trace Limiting**: Limits error stack traces to first 5 lines
- **Error Object Sanitization**: Safely serializes error objects without exposing sensitive data
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Provides safe fallbacks when sanitization fails

## 5. Best Practices Implemented

### Logging Security
- Never log raw user input without sanitization
- Always redact sensitive fields before logging
- Limit log message length to prevent DoS attacks
- Use structured logging with safe serialization

### React Security
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when possible
- When necessary, implement comprehensive input validation
- Use proper React patterns (hooks, effects) instead of script injection
- Always clean up event listeners and timeouts

### CSS Security
- Validate all CSS values against strict patterns
- Sanitize CSS property names and selectors
- Prevent CSS injection through dynamic styles
- Use allowlists for acceptable CSS values

## 6. Testing and Validation

### Security Tests
- Added test framework for chart component security
- Placeholder tests for color, key, and ID sanitization
- Error handling validation tests

### Manual Testing
- Verified all logging functions work correctly
- Tested chart component with various input types
- Validated offline page functionality without script injection
- Confirmed no sensitive data appears in logs

## 7. Future Recommendations

### Additional Security Measures
1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement strict CSP headers to prevent XSS
2. **Input Validation Middleware**: Create centralized input validation for API routes
3. **Security Headers**: Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
5. **Code Analysis**: Integrate static security analysis tools

### Monitoring
1. **Log Monitoring**: Monitor logs for injection attempts
2. **Error Tracking**: Enhanced error tracking with sanitized data
3. **Security Metrics**: Track security-related events and patterns

## 8. Impact Assessment
